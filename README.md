# wordlistFunctions
This was made to answer a rediculous question that I created in my head.
The question: What is the longest word in which both the even numbered letters and the odd numbered letters spell valid english words?
One such example is the word "Fiend". The odd numbered letters (the first, third and fifth) spell "Fed", while the even numbered letters spell "in".

This code will usilize a wordlist of over 100k words to try and find the answer.
